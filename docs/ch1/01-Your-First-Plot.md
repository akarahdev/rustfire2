# Your First Plot
To get started, follow the Setup instructions in the 
[Introduction](01-Your-First-Plot.md). Once that is done, you can now start
your first plot!

To get started, you should be familiar with the basic parts of Rust's syntax.
You can read up on it on the 
[Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch03-00-common-programming-concepts.html).
You should only have to worry about Chapter 3, and 3.1-3.4.

Once you are familiar with Rust slightly, we can begin our first plot.
